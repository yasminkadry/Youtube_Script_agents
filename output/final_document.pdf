I'm excited to introduce multi- aai agent systems with cre AI built in partnership with cre Ai and taught by Joe MOA who founder and CEO of cre AI I've really enjoyed playing with cre aai which is a very easy approachable way to build multiple large language modelbased agents they can interact with each other dedicate T to each other and collectively accomplish complex and productive workflows crei is being used by many developers to build little AI research teams to do online research and write reports or read Enterprise documents and provide analyses and there also a lot of exciting and creative use cases like simulating product managers and users to get feedback on a product or monitoring sensors in the manufacturing PL to flag when something deserves further investigation with multi-agent collaboration each agent plays A specialized role and executes specific tasks and they can share and request information from each other with defined roles this helps you to take a complex task and break it down into more manageable narrower task for individual L based agents to do I'm thrilled to introduce the instructor Joe who has started Qi when he needed a tool to build better agents that help him write LinkedIn Poe and Joe has a lot of experience designing workflows for collections of agents to execute thank you so much Andrew I'm super excited about this and there's so much potential for multi-agent systems out there I'm Blown Away by some of the use cases I'm seeing on how companies are already deploying these multiagent systems in production AI agents will be a big part in how business will be built and will evolve in the next decade and I want to make sure that we Empower Engineers to learn more on how to build this new AI systems for the future so in this course you'll learn all about multi agent systems we will go over the major components together and dive into each one including tools memory guard rails agenda cooporation and honestly so much more one thing that surprised me as I've been using Qi is not just how productive it can be but also how fun it is to quickly create a few agents and then work together I think you find it really fun as well to create your own agents delegate work to them and then see these agents that you just created with just a few lines of code run around and collaborate and get things done I really hope you enjoy the course and I see you in there
